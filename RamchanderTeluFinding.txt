Issue 1:
http://localhost:3000/bad_request API is misleading for the post operation.
Description say that 503 Gateway timeout response code when you try to do a POST, but in the response it says : Status 400 Bad Request


Issue 2: 

 http://localhost:3000/madeup API is missing the methods for POST and GET for madeup/last

Issue 3: http://localhost:3000/unauthorized API Response is incorrect, I believe it should "Status 401 Unauthorized"


-- Added few additional test cases spec files

below are the some of the testing findings :

Bug1 : for API no_reponse GET, response is "OK" instead "No Content"
Bug2 : for API bad_request GET, response is "OK" instead "bad request" and response code is 200 instead of 400
Bug3 : for API bad_request GET, response is "OK" instead "Internal Server Error" and response code is 200 instead of 500
